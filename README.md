# Real-Time Emotion Detection

This project is a real-time emotion detection system that uses computer vision and deep learning to identify human facial emotions from live webcam feed. It includes additional features beyond standard detection, such as logging detected emotions with timestamps and optional alerting.

## 📌 Features

✅ Detects emotions in real time using your webcam  
✅ Supports multiple emotions (e.g., Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprised, Neutral)  
✅ Logs detected emotions with timestamps to a CSV file  
✅ Optional pop-up or sound alerts on specific emotions  
✅ Clean, modular code for easy customization

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow / Keras (or PyTorch, depending on your implementation)
- NumPy, Pandas
- Pre-trained facial emotion recognition models
